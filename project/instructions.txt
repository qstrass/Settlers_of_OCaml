The board has been set up and we are ready to begin. 
If you have never played before, type a to learn more about the board. 
If you have played before, type b to move on. 

a:
Let's get to know the game before we get the die rolling. 
There are five different types of tiles on the board. 
  - Hills produce brick. 
  - Forest produces lumber. 
  - Mountains produce ore. 
  - Fields produce grain.
  - Pasture produces wool. 
Each tile also has a number which corresponds to the sum of two die which you
will roll on each turn.
Are you ready to begin? Type b. 

b:
So we are ready to build on the board! You currently have 5 settlements, 4 
cities, and 15 roads. To start, you must decide where to place 2 settlements
and 2 roads.
If you need some help, type c.
If you are ready, type d.

c: 
You must place a settlement on a corner of the map between tiles and a road
on an edge between tiles. 
After you roll the die on each turn, if the sum of the die matches one of the
tiles your settlement or road is touching, you get one unit of that material.
Acquiring material allows you to either uprgrade your settlement to a city or
build a new settlement or road. 
The numbers on each tile have a varying probability of being rolled. 
If you would like to see these frequencies, type die. 
If you are ready to move on, type d.


d: 
Where would you like to place your first settlement?
Where would you like to place your road? 
(REMINDER: This must be an edge connected to the corner where you placed the 
settlement)

Where would you like to place your second settlement?
Where would you like to place your road? 
(REMINDER: This must be an edge connected to the corner where you placed the 
settlement)



die:
  - 2 & 12 = 3%
  - 3 & 11 = 6%
  - 4 & 10 = 8%
  - 5 & 9 = 11%
  - 6 & 8 = 14%
  -     7 = 17%
